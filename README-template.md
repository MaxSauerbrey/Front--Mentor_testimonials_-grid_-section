## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Sass
- CSS Grid 
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive design

### What I learned

Learned and implemented Sass - variables, mixins. Working with Mobile first workflow is better for faster development. I've been working on CSS grid layouts.

### Continued development

I'll keep practising flexbox, CSS Grid and Media queries and Javascript.

### Useful resources

- [A Complete Guide to Grid ](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This helped me to understand CSS grid.
